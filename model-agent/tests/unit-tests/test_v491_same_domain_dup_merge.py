"""v4.9.1 alias=dup-product-same-domain-merge.

Live evidence, coffee_roastery run 564741857926303 (v4.8.8). The shipped model.json carried
BOTH of these in the wholesale domain:

    wholesale_invoice    39 attributes, 4 FKs
    invoice               3 attributes, 2 FKs   <- husk, reported as a global silo

One entity, two tables, one of them empty. Three defects produced it and all three are
exercised here against the real notebook code:

  P1  _validate_product_name_collisions Pass 2 buckets duplicates by product NAME, so a pair
      in ONE domain takes the cross-domain branch and gets RENAMED apart. Attribute rows key
      by (domain, product), so the rename hauls every attribute onto the renamed product and
      leaves the original a PK-plus-FK husk. Same name + same domain is one entity: merge it.

  P2  The v4.8.9 gates detect the pair, but neither `duplicate_product_pair` nor
      `duplicate_product_name` was in the SelfFixer `_fixable` whitelist, so no repair
      channel existed (CLAUDE.md 12.4 step 2).

  P3  The architect proposed exactly the right merge and the immutable guard rejected it,
      because the LLM core-product pass had marked `invoice` protected. Two consecutive
      rejections tripped IMMUTABLE-EARLY-EXIT and the WHOLE review was discarded. Merging an
      entity into itself preserves it, so protection must not veto it.
