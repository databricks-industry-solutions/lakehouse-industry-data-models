"""v4.8.3 — an in-flight metric-view repair must reach the shipped artifact.

When a metric view fails with UNRESOLVED_COLUMN the executor repairs it in the
worker (stale-column rewrite, DESCRIBE-driven rewrite, entry strip, safe
measures) and returns SUCCESS. Before this change the repaired SQL existed only
inside that worker: the statement written to metrics/*.sql and model.json stayed
the broken original. The agent's own catalog therefore had the view while every
consumer installing the published artifact lost it.

Live evidence: coffee_roastery v4.8.2 reported 24/24 views created; the
installer replaying the same artifact created 22/24, losing retail_order and
retail_loyalty_account to UNRESOLVED_COLUMN on `pickup_store_id`. A repo-wide
scan found 271 of 14904 shipped metric views in the same state.

`fallback_statements` is the channel the existing `mv-strict-parity-repair`
consumer already persists into the authoritative artifacts, so the repair sites
record into it rather than growing a second write path.
