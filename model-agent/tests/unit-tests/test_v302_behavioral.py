"""Behavioral tests for v3.0.2 orphan-recovery batch grouping fix.

ROOT CAUSE (healthcare ecm_v3 2026-06-02): the orphan-recovery path inside
_apply_batches_for_vreqs built ONE 1-VREQ Batch per orphan VREQ:

    for _oid in sorted(_orphan_ids):
        ...
        _recovery_batches.append(Batch(batch_id=f"orphan-recovery-{_oid}",
                                       vreq_ids=(str(_oid),), ...))

477 user directives that did not resolve to a concrete (domain,product) all
orphaned -> ~487 one-VREQ batches, each byte-split x3 -> 843 batches -> 1300+
LLM synthesis calls in iteration 1 -> 3.7h with no iteration close.

FIX (alias=v302-orphan-recovery-grouped): reuse the existing _heuristic_batch
grouper (deterministic_pre_group + target-resolve + 25-VREQ window) so orphans
are batched together. Batch is frozen, so batch_id is re-tagged via
dataclasses.replace.

Non-tautology (CLAUDE.md 8.10): test_orphan_path_uses_grouper_not_per_vreq
fails on pre-patch HEAD (the 1-per-VREQ pattern is present and the
_heuristic_batch delegation is absent), so the suite proves the routing change,
not just that the grouper exists.
