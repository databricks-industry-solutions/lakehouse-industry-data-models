"""v4.9.4 - two FKs to the same parent must name deterministically across call-sites.

Live residual (coffee_roastery v4.9.3, catalog vibe_e2e_v493):
  retail.pos_transaction had two FKs to retail.shopper.shopper_id. The SelfFixer
  multi_fk_missing_label pass relabeled one of them BETWEEN the model.json serialization
  boundary and the DDL stage. Because the aligner tried to bare-rename a well-formed
  labeled column and fell into an order-dependent collision relabel, the two call-sites
  resolved the names differently:
      model.json : {cashier_shopper_id, shopper_id}
      DDL        : {shopper_id, customer_shopper_id}
  -> 1 broken column reference of 930.

The v4.9.4 guard preserves any column already ending with '_<parent_pk>', so labeled FKs
are never touched and the result is identical no matter what ran in between.
