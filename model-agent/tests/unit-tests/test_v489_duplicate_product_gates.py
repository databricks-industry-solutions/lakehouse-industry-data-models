"""v4.8.9 alias=dup-product-gate-separator-blind.

Live evidence, coffee_roastery run 564741857926303: the published model.json and the
physical catalog both carried wholesale.invoice AND wholesale.wholesale_invoice, while
every one of the 11 static-analysis passes reported zero errors and the final pass logged
"4 warnings, 11 info". The architect reviewer saw the duplicate and prescribed the merge
("brings wholesale to 7"); nothing deterministic ever confirmed it landed, so the model
shipped 9 products in that domain against a user ceiling of 7.

Two causes, both reproduced here against the real notebook code:

  1. _validate_product_name_collisions Pass 2 buckets by product name ONLY, so a pair in
     the SAME domain enters the cross-domain branch and is renamed apart and reported as
     "duplicate of 'invoice' in another domain", which is false.
  2. The duplicate_product_pair gate compared f"{domain}_{pname}" against pname.lower().
     Pass 2 renames to PascalCase and a later pass canonicalises to snake, so in between
     the gate compares 'wholesale_invoice' against 'wholesaleinvoice' and sees nothing.
